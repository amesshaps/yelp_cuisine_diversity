Overview of Project

This project explores the cuisine diversity of 11 North American metros using the publicly accessible Yelp dataset. You can download the dataset [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

Diversity is something we should strive for; diverse systems allow for more inclusion and are more robust to change. Diverse areas may also be more enticing to visit as they allow a wider range of experiences. In order to investigate diversity, we can use diversity indices, which measure diversity through the number and abundance of different types in a dataset. In this project, I examine cuisine diversity among a group of North American metros by using the cuisine categories of their restaurants. I calculate three measures of diversity for each metro, as well as look deeper into the most and least common categories.
